## Task4

### Middlewares

- **Purpose**: Middlewares abstract and reuse common functionalities across the application, handling logging, authentication, and centralized error handling.
- **Benefits**: This design ensures route handlers remain focused on core business logic, enhancing code readability and maintainability. It simplifies debugging and makes the application robust by centralizing error management.

### Services and API Client

- **Purpose**: Services, including an API client configuration module, encapsulate the logic for external API interactions, using configured instances of HTTP clients for network requests.
- **Benefits**: Promotes code reuse and simplifies modifications to API interaction behaviors, such as changing base URLs or adding headers. It ensures consistency in API calls and error handling, enhancing maintainability and testability.

### Routes

- **Purpose**: A modular approach to route definitions enhances the application's scalability and maintainability by abstracting routing details from server setup.
- **Benefits**: Simplifies adding or modifying routes without cluttering server initialization code, supporting clear separation of concerns.

### Handlers

- **Purpose**: Handlers manage the application's business logic and presentation layer, facilitating server-side rendering by fetching data and rendering components based on that data.
- **Benefits**: Supports clean architecture principles, making the system more maintainable and adaptable to changes.
